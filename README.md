# A guide to understand and build a sequencer for a rhythm game using Stepmaniaâ€™s `SSC` definitions

This guide aims to assist anyone in creating a sequencer for a rhythm
game. A sequencer is a software that manages two crucial aspects of any
rhythm game:

1.  The timing of when the notes should be tapped concerning the
    beginning of the song.

2.  The placement of the notes at any given time.

In this guide, we will delve into these two aspects when introducing
gimmicks in the game. Gimmicks are alterations in these two aspects that
provide additional (usually aesthetic) possibilities to step makers.
Specifically, we will examine the StepMania approach to defining the
settings required to set up a sequencer. Each definition will be
analyzed in its own separate section, with examples provided, and
mathematical formalism that can be easily implemented in the programming
language of your choice at the end of each section.
